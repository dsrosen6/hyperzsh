# hyperzsh-dr
hyperzsh + dr (my initials, I truly cooked with that one)

## What is it?
This is my personal fork of the zsh theme[hyperzsh](https://github.com/tylerreckart/hyperzsh). For documentation, go to the original repository. 

## What's different?
Right now, the only difference is I removed the user host from the prompt.

## Who is this for?
Anyone who wants some random guy's fork of a zsh theme. So, probably just me. But feel free to use it :smile:
